# Personal Portfolio Website

A modern personal portfolio website built to showcase projects, skills, and professional approach. The goal of this project is to create a clean, expressive, and technically solid interface that not only displays work but also reflects mindset, taste, and attention to detail.

## 💡 Concept

This site acts as a digital business card — minimalistic, adaptive, and alive.  
It combines product thinking, aesthetic balance, and smooth interaction.  
Each block is designed for clarity, fast perception, and pleasant scrolling experience.

## 🚀 Core Sections

- **Hero / Intro** — short intro and main tagline.  
- **About Me** — personal information, background, and professional focus.  
- **Services** — key directions and expertise areas.  
- **My Projects** — project gallery with visuals and structured table of works.  
- **Contact / Feedback** — contact form and direct communication links.

Every section is visually separated with smooth transitions, ensuring strong visual hierarchy and readability across devices.

## 🎨 Design & Aesthetic

The interface is built around contrast and clarity.  
Rounded cards, deep shadows, and balanced spacing create a premium look without overloading the layout.  
Both **light** and **dark** themes are available — fully synchronized for readability and consistency.  

Typography follows a modern sans-serif system (Inter / system-ui) for professional tone and accessibility.

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** for semantic and accessible structure.  
- **CSS3 (custom variables + modern layout grid)** for clean responsive design.  
- **Vanilla JS** for interactive elements like theme switching and lightbox.  
- **No frameworks** — pure, fast, and lightweight build focused on performance.
